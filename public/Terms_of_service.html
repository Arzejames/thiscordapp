        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> Feb 13, 2025</p>
        
        <p>Welcome to ThisCord! By using our service, you agree to abide by these Terms of Service ("Agreement").

        <h2>1. Data Storage & Privacy</h2>
        <p>At ThisCord, we take data management seriously. However, it is important for you to be aware that <strong>all messages, passwords, and user information are stored in plain text.</strong> This means that your data is not encrypted and is accessible by ThisCord administrators when necessary.</p>
        <p>Additionally, <strong>we can see the passwords you enter when you create an account</strong>, as they are not encrypted. By creating an account with ThisCord, you <strong>explicitly consent to the collection and storage of your data in this manner.</strong> Please note that while we take reasonable precautions to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you acknowledge that <strong>you may not have complete control over your dataâ€™s protection</strong> while using the Service.</p>
    
        <h2>2. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>We believe in fostering a positive and respectful environment for all users of ThisCord. As such, we have a strict <strong>zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate content or conduct</strong>. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of:</p>
