# ThisCord

ThisCord is a knock of version of discord which is written in node.js using socket.io that I made because I needed more projects to submit for my computer science class.

## Download and Start

The the following command to download the code:
`git clone https://github.com/Arzejames/thiscordapp.git`

Next install the dependencies with the following command:
`npm install express socket.io`  

Then use this command to run the code:
`node server.js`

If you want to make changes and you don't want to restart the server, use the command:
`nodemon server.js`
(You will need to install nodemon with `npm install nodemon` if you don't already have it installed)
